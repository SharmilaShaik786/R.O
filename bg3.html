                <h2>Understanding pH Levels</h2>
                <p>pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a substance is on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Water with a pH lower than 7 is considered acidic, while water with a pH higher than 7 is considered alkaline.</p>

                <h2>The Role of pH in Water Quality</h2>
                <p>The pH level of water can significantly affect its quality and suitability for various uses. For example, drinking water with a very high or very low pH can be harmful to human health, as it can cause corrosion of pipes and leach toxic metals like lead and copper into the water supply.</p>

                <h2>Optimal pH Levels for Drinking Water</h2>
                <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that the pH of drinking water be between 6.5 and 8.5. Water within this range is generally safe for consumption and poses minimal risk of corroding pipes and leaching metals.</p>

                <h2>pH and Water Treatment</h2>
                <p>Water treatment processes often involve adjusting the pH to ensure safety and effectiveness. For example, water with a low pH may be treated with alkaline substances to neutralize acidity, while water with a high pH may be treated with acids to lower the pH to a safer level.</p>

        <p>Monitoring and maintaining the pH level of water is crucial for ensuring its quality and safety for various applications, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial processes. By understanding the importance of pH and its impact on water quality, we can take steps to ensure that the water we use is safe and suitable for its intended purpose.</p>
